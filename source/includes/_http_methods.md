# HTTP Methods

## GET
Make a GET request to retrieve data. GET requests will never cause an update or change to your data because theyâ€™re safe and [idempotent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/idempotent).

## POST
Use a POST request to create new entries, forms, Views, or fields. POST can also be used to update an entry, form, View, or field.

## PATCH
Make a PATCH request to update an entry, form, View, or field. With PATCH requests, you only need to provide the data you want to change.

## PUT
Use a PUT request to create or update an entry, form, View, or field.

## DELETE
Make a DELETE request to delete an entry, form, View, or field.
